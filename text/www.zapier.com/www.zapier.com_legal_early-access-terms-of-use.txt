Term. Zapier may, in its sole discretion, at any time, terminate or discontinue the Zapier Early Access Program or any or all Beta Features offered through it, discontinue your participation in the Zapier Early Access Program, or remove any Feedback that you share. You acknowledge and agree that all such decisions by Zapier are final and Zapier will have no liability with respect to such decisions.7.
