Zapier helps make sure your Firebase data is accurate by automatically keeping your records updated. You can use Zapier's custom tools to schedule updates or add RSS feed items to Firebase so you can spend less time worrying about your infrastructure and more time focused on your users.Connect Firebase / Firestore to 5,000+ appsSupported triggers and actionsWhat does this mean?TriggersActionsTriggers & ActionsTriggers & ActionsNew Child Object in a Firebase Realtime DatabaseTriggers when a new child object is discovered within a specific path.PathRequiredSpecify the path to the object's key which contains the child objects to be queried, such as foo/bar/here.OrderThe child key/path that should be used to compare objects/records. If nothing is specified, then the $key order is used. Learn more here.Location of newest objectsIndicates whether the new records are at the "top" of the ordering, or the "bottom".

This is useful if an application has an API endpoint that Zapier doesn't implement yet. You will be expected to read and utilize the API documentation provided by the application. Further, if the application changes their API, you will be expected to make the appropriate fixes and updates.Api Docs InfoAPI docs for Firebase / Firestore are located here https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/HTTP MethodRequiredURLRequiredRequests can only be made to domains associated by this application.Query String ParametersThese params will be URL-encoded and appended to the URL when making the request.HeadersAuthentication headers are included automaticallyAdditional Request HeadersZapier will apply these optional headers and values to the request in addition to any headers created as part of the authentication mechanism.BodyZapier will pass this along raw. If you would like to provide complex JSON, try a "Code by Zapier" step to build the structure and pass it along here.
