Further, if the application changes their API, you will be expected to make the appropriate fixes and updates.Api Docs InfoAPI docs for Typeform are located here https://www.typeform.com/help/data-api/HTTP MethodRequiredURLRequiredRequests can only be made to domains associated by this application.Query String ParametersThese params will be URL-encoded and appended to the URL when making the request.HeadersAuthentication headers are included automaticallyAdditional Request HeadersZapier will apply these optional headers and values to the request in addition to any headers created as part of the authentication mechanism.BodyZapier will pass this along raw.
