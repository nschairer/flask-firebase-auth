Automation makes those tools less labor-intensive by automatically adding data from all your important apps.Automating your reporting process lets you reduce time spent mindlessly transferring data between programs and reduces the possibility of human error (we tend to think repetitive copy-and-pasting should be delegated to a computer). With less time spent managing data, you can use your judgment to interpret and act on the insight you've gained.This set of automated workflows created with Zapier—we call them Zaps—will let you track, measure, and improve any aspect of your work by automatically connecting your data to the apps you use to understand it.If you want to improve on something, the best thing to do is start measuring its performance. This set of Zaps will easily let you track, measure, and improve anything you'd like. Not sure which tools are best for you? Check out our comprehensive review of dashboard, analytics, and chart creation apps.To get started with one of these Zaps, just click on the button and you'll be guided through set-up. If you'd like to learn more about what Zaps are and how they work, you can read our help doc on the basics of creating a Zap.You'll need a Zapier account to use the workflows in this piece. If you don't have an account yet, it's free to get started.Table of contents:ReportsChartsDashboardsReportsReports are useful for analyzing and communicating information at work, but manually gathering data, assembling it, and sharing the resulting reports with stakeholders can be frustrating and repetitive.
