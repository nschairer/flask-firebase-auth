Whether it's your first home-cooked meal or a new business venture—the feeling of creating something out of nothing is magical. And the same goes for automation. When you use Zapier's no-code automation tools, it's to accomplish more than just time savings and productivity boosts. It's to unlock a superpower that you wouldn't have otherwise. Zapier allows you to build critical solutions that automate your business. This made us wonder: If the feeling of building is so magical, why aren't we all automating more? Because automation wasn't designed for everyone—it was designed for programmers. Let's take a quick look at how we got here. Barriers to automation For the past 50 years, a lot of energy and investment has gone into building technical tools for technical people, including those who know how to code. But not everyone has the time, skillset, or budget to learn how to code, build, or maintain custom-coded solutions. Especially at scale across a business or an organization. That's not to say there isn't an appetite for building business-critical solutions. Collectively, Zapier users automate two billion tasks per month. Per month! This astronomical number is a testament to this community's ingenuity and persistence to advance no-code automation. It also makes one thing crystal clear: Every tool traditionally built for programmers and software developers needs a no-code alternative designed for non-programmers, so they can create their own automation solutions.This is where Zapier bridges the gap. Connecting the dots Over the last 10 years, we've seen many of you embrace automation to push Zapier to the limits—more than we ever could have imagined. We also know some of you are stretching beyond what's possible today and that you can only build your businesses on top of so many workarounds.That's why we're expanding Zapier. With the following new products, you'll have three of the same core tools programmers use to build cohesive automation solutions, but of the no-code variety:Transfer makes it easier than ever for you to move bulk data on demand.Tables allows you to create databases to save, edit, access, and share the data needed to run your Zaps. You can even connect a Zap and process triggered records directly from your table. Interfaces equips you to build dynamic interfaces for your end users—like customers or coworkers—to interact with the workflows you're building.Combine all three of these tools with Zapier, and you and your team can build reliable and powerful end-to-end automated workflows—without writing a single line of code. Building better products for you, with youTransfer, Tables, and Interfaces are currently in alpha and beta. Why? If the last decade has taught us anything, it's that it's critical to build tools in a tight feedback loop with early users to ensure it's actually useful. This is core to our product development philosophy. But this doesn't mean you can't access the future of no-code automation today. We're thrilled to introduce Zapier Early Access which gives automation enthusiasts early access to cutting-edge, no-code tools including Transfer, Tables, Interfaces, and future automation-first products.  How Zapier Early Access works Members of the Zapier Early Access program will have the opportunity to connect directly with Zapier product teams, unlock current and future new products, and join an influential community of automation enthusiasts. Here's what that looks like exactly: Get notified. Each time a new product or feature is available, members will receive details on how to get access before anyone else. Test it out. Dive right into new features and products immediately and start crafting your own workflows. Give your feedback. Tell us in real time what worked—and what didn't—so we can incorporate the most common and valuable feedback back into the tools. Build the future of automationJoin Zapier Early AccessA future of endless possibilities We've said it before, and we'll say it again: The future of no-code automation tools would not be possible without the input of folks like you—our curious and ingenious customers. We believe if everyone can leverage the power of automation, the possibilities of what we can build are endless—and we're so excited to work with our community to put this belief to the test. Here's to building together, so we can keep building for the world. To learn more about the latest product updates in Zapier, check out our recap.A version of this article was first presented as the keynote talk at Zapier's user conference, ZapConnect 2022.

It's true in remote companies, it's true in hybrid companies, and it's increasingly true in companies that mostly work in physical offices. Don't let meetings dominate your workAutomate video callsSo low-quality video calls aren't a niche problem—they're bad for productivity all around. Every dropped call is a major annoyance, and it's also not acceptable to waste time waiting for someone to set up software that's not intuitive.That's why we did our homework for this article. We considered over 30 video conferencing apps and spent a lot of time testing to see how they stacked up. Here are the five best.The 5 best video conferencing platformsZoom for reliable, large video callsWebex Meetings for video qualityGoogle Meet for Google Workspace usersMicrosoft Teams for combining team chat and video conferencingWhereby for a lightweight optionWhat makes a great video conferencing app?How we evaluate and test appsAll of our best apps roundups are written by humans who've spent much of their careers using, testing, and writing about software. We spend dozens of hours researching and testing apps, using each app as it's intended to be used and evaluating it against the criteria we set for the category. We're never paid for placement in our articles from any app or for links to any site—we value the trust readers put in us to offer authentic evaluations of the categories and apps we review. For more details on our process, read the full rundown of how we select apps to feature on the Zapier blog.The most important thing for video conferencing is video quality. That goes beyond how the picture looks—the best quality in the world doesn't matter if people cut out or calls drop constantly. We tested each online meeting app to see how well it performed when the quality of the internet connection changed.But that's not the only thing we were thinking of. There are many consumer-facing video chat apps—Apple's FaceTime, for example—that wouldn't work as a video conferencing app. Businesses need more than just a solid video connection to do meetings. In summary, the best video conferencing apps:Offer high-quality video and audio, reliably. If web conferencing software can only do one thing, this has to be it.Make it straightforward to start, schedule, and join meetings. Ideally, meetings can be quickly scheduled and added to your calendar, and there should be obvious links to click when it's time to join the call.Include collaboration features. Screen sharing and chat are the bare minimum. The best online video conferencing apps go beyond this to offer whiteboarding or even direct collaboration features. Allow for video recording. Not everyone can make every meeting—recordings help bridge that gap. Recording a meeting should be as simple as clicking a button in your online meeting software.Make it simple to add people outside your organization. Anyone should be able to click a link and join your meeting without much fuss (though there should also be security features to keep out unwanted participants).We kept all of these features in mind while considering which Zoom alternatives to test (let's face it—that's what they are), and also focused on these features while testing.The best video conferencing app for reliable, large video callsZoom (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web)You already know about Zoom. People who literally live under rocks know about Zoom. It's the most popular video conferencing app out there, and for good reason: it just works.You can share a link to a Zoom meeting and feel confident that everyone will be able to join it. There are apps for every major platform, and at this point, you can assume everyone already installed the software and configured it to work. Joining a meeting is as simple as clicking the link. It's hard to overstate how valuable that is: nothing drags a meeting down quite like someone not being able to join. Zoom is also extremely reliable. It will typically keep your video going even through a weak internet connection, just at a reduced quality level. You can record any call as a full-length video, and participants can also use text chat to talk with each other, either as a group or as individual private messages. And you can share your screen, an individual app, or just one section of your screen. You can even share audio from your computer, if you want. Zoom's added a lot of features recently. It now offers one the best whiteboards on the market, making it really quick to fill a virtual board with diagrams, images, and sticky notes. There's also support for real-time transcriptions, complete with closed captioning. The design here could be a little better—it's hard to tell who's saying what—but you can clear this up by reviewing the transcript of the meeting. Zoom lets you schedule video conference calls in advance, chat anytime with any of your contacts, or connect to room conferencing hardware. All in all, it's a nearly perfect team video app. You can do even more with Zoom by connecting it to Zapier, taking the busywork out of meeting prep and follow-up. For example, you can automatically add Zoom calls to your calendar, schedule video conferences when someone books an appointment, or get notifications for upcoming meetings.Create Zoom meetings for new Calendly eventsCreate Zoom meetings for new Calendly eventsTry itCalendly, ZoomCalendly + ZoomAdd new Zoom meetings to Google CalendarAdd new Zoom meetings to Google CalendarTry itZoom, Google CalendarZoom + Google CalendarEmail Zoom meeting links to customers when new bookings are made via OnceHubEmail Zoom meeting links to customers when new bookings are made via OnceHubTry itOnceHub, Zoom, Email by ZapierOnceHub + Zoom + Email by ZapierZoom price: Free for up to 100 participants for 40-minute meetings; from $14.99/month/host with the Pro plan, which includes user management, unlimited meeting length, and reporting.If you decide to go with Zoom, take a look at our roundup of 10 tips and tricks for Zoom and 6 ways to automate Zoom.The best video conferencing app for video qualityWebex Meetings (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web)Cisco is a leading manufacturer of video conferencing hardware. Webex Meetings is their video call app. As you might expect, the focus is on video quality, and Webex delivers. We immediately noticed that everyone looks and sounds better on this service—both in terms of image and sound quality and in terms of stability—and it's not particularly close. Users can join meetings by downloading and installing the application or by using the web version. The collaborative features are particularly noteworthy. There's an excellent whiteboard, comparable to what's offered by any other app, complete with drawing, text, sticky notes, and even a ""magic pen"" feature that tidies up your messy rectangles and circles. You can even share a document without sharing your screen—everyone in the meeting can mark up the file in place. It's a great way to think out loud about a project as a group. Don't overlook Webex. If you tried it a couple years ago, you might want to try it again—it's been completely overhauled and is now easily one of the best video conferencing apps out there. The only reason we're putting it below Zoom here is Zoom's pure ubiquity. By connecting Webex to your other apps with Zapier, it's easy to keep your meetings running smoothly. You can automatically add scheduled Webex meetings to your calendar, for example, or get a reminder in your favorite chat app when a meeting is about to start.Add Cisco Webex Meetings to Google CalendarAdd Cisco Webex Meetings to Google CalendarTry itCisco Webex Meetings, Google CalendarCisco Webex Meetings + Google CalendarCreate Microsoft Outlook events for Cisco Webex MeetingsCreate Microsoft Outlook events for Cisco Webex MeetingsTry itCisco Webex Meetings, Microsoft OutlookCisco Webex Meetings + Microsoft OutlookSend a Slack reminders for new Cisco Webex MeetingsSend a Slack reminders for new Cisco Webex MeetingsTry itCisco Webex Meetings, SlackCisco Webex Meetings + SlackWebex price: There's a free plan for meetings with up to 100 people, but it lacks some important features like screen sharing and recordings. From $25/user/month for the Business plan for advanced team features.The best video conferencing app for Google Workspace usersGoogle Meet (iOS, Android, Web)Google Meet's best feature, perhaps, is its deep integration with Google's other apps. Whenever you create a meeting in Google Calendar, you'll get a Meet link that you and your meeting attendees can click to instantly join a call. And when you're in the middle of a call, you can find files from Google Drive and share them in chat, without leaving your call. You can even start a call directly from your Gmail inbox. And then there's the integration with Chrome, including a tab-sharing feature that's great for media sharing, with very little lag when used to stream a short video as a group (it doesn't work in other browsers, though).Other apps, like Zoom, are catching up, but Google Meet still does live captions better than the competition. The captions work fairly well in English, though it can't detect when other languages are spoken on a call. Meet is a popular Zoom alternative, but it runs in a browser, not an app. This can be seen as a plus, because you don't need to install anything. In our experience, though, browser-based apps tend to struggle on a large video conference call. Meet is no exception—large calls result in loud laptop fans and reduced quality. In our experience, Meet also doesn't degrade calls as gracefully as Zoom when your internet connection is slow. But there is a workaround: you can opt to have up to 100,000 participants join via view-only mode. This mode doesn't display participants' video, so they'll only see and hear whoever is leading the call. Though it's not the same as a true group video conference, since it limits their ability to chime in, it's a decent option if you just need one or two people to present to a large group.Hybrid companies, or companies with multiple locations, can use the Meet conference room devices for full-room video chats and the Jamboard touchscreen device for team collaboration. And, if your company is already paying for Google Workspace, it's essentially free. With Zapier, you can connect Google Meet to the other apps you use most. For example, you can automatically schedule calls with leads, no matter where they reach you.Schedule Google Meet video calls instantly from a Google Sheets spreadsheetSchedule Google Meet video calls instantly from a Google Sheets spreadsheetTry itGoogle Sheets, Google MeetGoogle Sheets + Google MeetSchedule video calls with new Facebook Lead Ads leads on Google MeetSchedule video calls with new Facebook Lead Ads leads on Google MeetTry itFacebook Lead Ads, Google MeetFacebook Lead Ads + Google MeetSend new Calendly invitees a Google Meet video linkSend new Calendly invitees a Google Meet video linkTry itCalendly, Google MeetCalendly + Google MeetGoogle Meet Price: Free for up to 100 participants and up to 60 minutes; from $6/month/user as part of Google Workspace Business Starter.Read more: Streamline your Google Meet calls with these automation tipsThe best combination team chat and video conference appMicrosoft Teams (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, Web)Most team chat apps struggle with video, or treat it as an afterthought. Not Microsoft Teams, which offers some of the most robust video conferencing features on the market—in addition to its team chat offerings.The whiteboard is great. You can draw freehand, and the program smooths things out—a crappy circle becomes a perfect one, for example. This makes it easy to take notes and diagram things on the fly. And there are plenty of other collaboration features here. The chat from the meeting, for example, is saved in your team chat app for future reference. There's a built-in feature for meeting notes, which are also shared with the team after the meeting. You can even automatically transcribe meetings and share that. None of this would matter if the video quality wasn't great. It is. Teams works well even with large calls, and there are all kinds of features for helping the meeting go smoothly. Some, like the together mode seen in the above screenshot, are gimmicks, sure, but even gimmicks can help with team cohesion. It's not a perfect app. Microsoft has a tendency to keep adding features to its apps, cluttering up the interface. That's very much the case with Teams. And while it's easy to invite people outside your organization to a Teams meeting, it's not as seamless as Zoom. Expect hiccups if someone doesn't already have Teams installed. As for the cost? You're probably already paying for it because Teams comes bundled with basically every version of Microsoft Office. If you want a team chat app that also offers high-quality video conferencing, Teams is worth checking out. And you can do even more with Teams by connecting it to Zapier. For example, you can get notifications in Teams whenever your team has a new lead, a new event registration, or a new deal.

Most of them aim to make it easy for anyone to quickly create a meeting link, share it, and start a meeting because simplicity is the point.Whereby is the best app in this sub-category. If you want to quickly start video meetings, Whereby is perfect. Starting and sharing a link couldn't be much easier, and in our tests, no one had trouble joining. There's support for up to 100 people, a prominent record button, a chat function, and screen sharing.There's also an integration feature, which works differently from anything else we tested. Most video conferencing apps rely on some version of screen sharing for collaboration. Whereby actually embeds productivity apps right on the page. For example: open the Google Docs integration, and a document will be loaded right there in the meeting. Everyone can edit the document right there, after logging in to Google Docs, because this isn't a video of the document—it's the actual document, in the window, alongside your video chat. You could argue that Whereby integrates with Google Docs better than Google Meet does. The YouTube integration also works better in Whereby than in Meet, which tells us Google could learn a few things from this app.If you're looking for browser-based web meeting software—one that doesn't require accounts for participants—check out Whereby first.Whereby pricing: Free plan includes up to 100 participants and group meetings up to 45 minutes; from $6.99/month/user for the Pro plan, which offers unlimited group meetings, recording, and custom branding and domains.What's the best web conference software?What's the best web conference software?Video conferencing platforms all claim to do the same thing: allow you to host meetings remotely and still see each other's faces.

Rideshare drivers could earn extra money by installing the Halo Cars hardware and displaying ads on and in their cars. The team tested things while school was in session, and it did very well. They took the company full-time, raised a round of funding, and were growing very quickly.Halo Cars' co-founders, from left to right, Faizan Bhatty, Kenan Saleh, and Ryanne Fadel.Halo Cars was founded in 2018 and acquired by Lyft about 10 months later. The company is now part of Lyft, called Lyft Media. Kenan is general manager and head of that division. Their earliest growth was fueled by a high-touch onboarding process. They focused on drivers who worked in the most desirable areas. Interested drivers could apply on the website—then the hands-on work started. ""It used to be a completely manual process,"" Kenan said. ""It was someone on a spreadsheet who would call people, update the spreadsheet, send an email, receive the response, then organize it in Google Drive. This was all done by our driver onboarding team.""Our stories explore how people at businesses of all sizes use Zapier to solve common problems, get more done, and move forward faster. If you haven't yet, try Zapier for free to see what we're all about. Halo Cars team members sent drivers instructions about how to qualify for the program. If accepted, they'd send out documentation, set up an installation appointment, and send out reminders to the driver and others at Halo.  ""There were more than 10 manual interventions and probably 2-3 hours spent per driver,"" Kenan said.  Growth powered by automation That's when they turned to Zapier, a platform that allowed them to easily create custom automated workflows to handle these manual tasks. After setting up a few Zaps—the word for a workflow created in Zapier—they'd dramatically reduced their hands-on time.Zapier is a no-code automation tool that empowers anyone to automate workflows and move data across 5,000+ apps. Our automatic workflows—which we call Zaps—send data between apps you use so every person and business can move forward at growth speed. Check out this page to learn how Zapier works.""By the end, there were 0-1 steps, where if something went wrong we jumped in and fixed it. It went from hours to minutes. We automated everything. It made the process so much more scalable,"" Kenan said. When they started, the team could onboard about 10 drivers per day. After automating the process, it was hundreds. And the people who used to manage that process found themselves with time to work more creative and challenging tasks. ""People were excited,"" Kenan said. ""We were not automating people's jobs. We were automating this really annoying process that everyone had to do and no one wanted to do. When they found out that was going to be automated, it was 'Thank goodness I don't have to do that anymore.' They were very happy."" And, after introducing Zapier to the team, Kenan said, people found other things to automate, too. The sales team set up workflows to automatically create calendar events and track sales in Airtable. They added automation to their equipment issue reporting and notification system.Learn more about how Halo Cars uses Airtable.'The glue' that ties their systems together Even after the acquisition, their reliance on automation with Zapier didn't change. ""We still use all of them today,"" Kenan said. ""We brought it with us. There's no way we could operate without it."" Kenan and the team—now known as Lyft Media, a unit within rideshare giant Lyft—rely on Zapier to help them connect apps like Airtable, DocuSign, Twilio, Google Sheets, and Google Drive. ""The Airtable and Zapier combo is very important,"" he said. ""We use Airtable as our CRM and our home base and Zapier as the glue that connects all of that together."" The team uses Zapier to send things into Airtable, but also has Zaps that watch for changes in Airtable that then kick off workflows in other apps. ""We're using Airtable as our CRM, so when something comes in, it goes into Airtable,"" he said. ""Then, when there's a status change, that triggers another Zap. Everything will be recorded in Airtable and Zapier makes all these other things happen. That combo is really important to us."" Here are a few Airtable Zaps to start with: Add new Typeform entries to Airtable as recordsAdd new Typeform entries to Airtable as recordsTry itTypeform, AirtableTypeform + AirtableSend Gmail messages for new Airtable records in viewsSend Gmail messages for new Airtable records in viewsTry itAirtable, GmailAirtable + GmailPost notifications about new Airtable records in a view to SlackPost notifications about new Airtable records in a view to SlackTry itAirtable, SlackAirtable + SlackSend Twilio SMS messages with new Airtable records in viewSend Twilio SMS messages with new Airtable records in viewTry itAirtable, TwilioAirtable + Twilio Beyond the Airtable Zaps, Kenan said the team uses Zapier to set up workflows that can accomplish more than one task from a single starting point. For example, from a single form submission, they can create a record in Airtable, send an email, post in chat, and text someone. Automation for outsized impact ""It's hard to quantify"" how much time and money Zapier has saved the team, Kenan said. ""It's countless, countless hours of manual time. Like, hundreds, thousands, of hours over the lifetime of our business. Let's say it took an hour per task, and over the lifetime of our business, we've done tens of thousands of these tasks. We've saved at least 10s of thousands of manual time-intensive hours."" They never quantified automation from a budget standpoint, but Kenan said that when they started, they were paying about $100 a month for their Zapier account. If they'd decided to code things instead, it would have cost them tens—or hundreds—of thousands to hire or contract with someone to write the code.  ""Zapier allowed us to do a lot more than we thought we could do with the size of our team,"" he said. ""At the time of being acquired, we had about 10 full-time employees. Lyft was surprised with how small we were and what we were doing. They were shocked that we didn't have a big engineering team."" At every stage, when they talked with agencies, investors, everyone was impressed with how much they were able to do and how quickly they could grow and scale. ""I remember people saying how quickly we responded to email and handled tasks,"" Kenan said. ""Zapier is part of why we were able to do that. We were able to act and function like a much bigger team and to do things very quickly.""What's your story? Tell us how you use Zapier to do more.

And their area of expertise makes it even more difficult. The post-conviction criminal legal system has additional complications. From procedural barriers involved in appealing convictions to the challenges of working with clients who are imprisoned and need to communicate by mail or phone, the Georgia Innocence Project needs to manage many moving parts.""Reversing a conviction after-the-fact is incredibly difficult—in Georgia, it's only been done 46 times in the past 30 years—yet we estimate that there are hundreds if not thousands of innocent Georgians currently in prison for crimes they did not commit,"" Matt said. ""The essence of our work is finding ways around obstacles, so having reliable systems, clear processes, and consistent information is critical—and Zapier underpins all of that.""Our stories explore how people at businesses of all sizes use Zapier to solve common problems, get more done, and move forward faster. If you haven't yet, try Zapier for free to see what we're all about.Matt started at the Georgia Innocence Project five years ago as its second full-time employee. He and the team—the executive director, a part-time bookkeeper, and a handful of volunteers and interns—did their work in a tiny basement office next to a bowling alley. He handled all the day-to-day operations, including office administration, communications, IT, volunteer and intern management, and fundraising. Since then, they've grown to a staff of 17 and moved into a real office, and Matt's been able to dedicate his time to supporting the team and developing and improving the processes and policies that allow them to get work done.Georgia Innocence Project uses:Google Forms to collect information from many placesCode by Zapier to assign unique identifiers to requestsGoogle Drive to store documentsClio as a centralized client and case databaseWebhooks by Zapier for versatility Api2Pdf to prepare envelope information for printingGetting started by organizing communication Communication is at the heart of what the Georgia Innocence Project does. Information came to them over the phone: everything from clients calling for updates on cases, people asking how they can support their work, and law enforcement agencies responding to requests for information. Volunteers and interns took down information about the calls and passed the notes on to the right person. In his first week, Matt noticed many of these handwritten messages landed on the executive director's desk. Matt wanted to eliminate those notes and started by creating a digital call log using Google Forms, sending all the responses to a spreadsheet. That was better, but it still required a lot of manual work to distribute things to the right people. That's when he came across Zapier and set up an automated workflow—called a Zap—that automatically emailed the message logged in the form to the right person after it came in. The person taking the message noted the email address of the person who needed to see the message, and then the Zap gathered the message information and sent it in an email.Send email via Gmail for new Google Forms submissionsSend email via Gmail for new Google Forms submissionsTry itGoogle Forms, GmailGoogle Forms + GmailThen, if it turned out that the message needed to go to someone else, it was easy to forward it to the right person.You'll need a Zapier account to use the workflows in this piece. If you don't have an account yet, it's free to get started.How automation powers the Georgia Innocence Project's workWhile trials are what come to mind when people think about criminal convictions, appeals work is done mainly on paper. It's collecting information, keeping people informed, and sending things out. Matt has woven automation throughout their processes, creating systems that give staff space to litigate cases, raise funds, and keep clients updated—without having to spend time on fiddly, manual tasks. Open records requests""We have to collect a lot of public documents when re-investigating cases, and so have dozens of pending requests at any given time,"" Matt said. ""Tracking and following up on those requests is critical to our investigation process.""Google Forms is the starting place for this, too. Attorneys and interns fill out a form for each request. The first part of the Zap uses a code step to generate a unique ID that's added to a central tracking spreadsheet. The Zap creates a folder in Google Drive where the request file and any responses are stored, and that file is added as a record in the client's Clio case file. The request is then sent off automatically to the agency, using Gmail if they accept requests that way, otherwise by fax or mail. Responses are tracked using that unique ID generated by the code step, and if they're emailed back, are automatically added to the original folder.Envelope printingWorking with people in prison means a lot of their communication has to go through the mail.""One thing that used to be a constant irritation was printing envelopes,"" Matt said. ""We had interns/staff using many different devices, and printing through Word yielded inconsistent results and a lot of wasted time (addresses would be printed upside down, or would be oriented the wrong way, or on the wrong type of paper).""Now, they use the Zapier Chrome Extension as a simple place where people can enter a mailing address. A Webhooks step sends the address to a service called api2pdf which creates an envelope PDF, and then another webhook sends the PDF off to PrintNode for printing.""Instead of fussing with Word settings and printer defaults, I just send folks to the extension,"" Matt said.You can start a Zap like this one using this template: Send POSTs to another URL for new pushes with fieldsSend POSTs to another URL for new pushes with fieldsTry itZapier Chrome extension, Webhooks by ZapierZapier Chrome extension + Webhooks by ZapierRead more: Learn more ways to automatically print shipping labels and more ways to use the Zapier Chrome Extension.Applicant intakePeople wanting the Georgia Innocence Project to look at their case write in to apply, and staff then need to create case files in their case management system, Clio. ""Consistency is key in creating these files, so that we can properly track and report on our cases,"" Matt said. ""We used to create each new file manually, but last year switched over to using a Google Form to collect and (crucially) validate information and automatically create the case file.""From that Google Forms trigger, they implement several Clio action steps, creating the case file and linking assets like the prison where the applicant is being held, so everything is tied together and ready for staff to review. The Zap also creates time entries and follow-up tasks. Here's a starting point for a system like this: Create Clio matters from new Google Forms responsesCreate Clio matters from new Google Forms responsesTry itGoogle Forms, ClioGoogle Forms + ClioIntern and staff hiringHiring used to require a significant amount of work to gather and collate information, then review it and compare. They've now automated the process, using a combination of Gmail and Google Forms. They use Zaps to automatically create folders that store application materials, add information to tracking spreadsheets, email candidates, and alert the hiring manager when things are ready to review. Possible example Zaps: Send email via Gmail for new Google Forms submissionsSend email via Gmail for new Google Forms submissionsTry itGoogle Forms, GmailGoogle Forms + GmailAdd Google Sheets rows for new Google Forms responsesAdd Google Sheets rows for new Google Forms responsesTry itGoogle Forms, Google SheetsGoogle Forms + Google SheetsSave new Gmail attachments to Google DriveSave new Gmail attachments to Google DriveTry itGmail, Filter by Zapier, Google DriveGmail + Filter by Zapier + Google DriveAutomation as a foundation for focused work""With all of the different Zaps we have going, I think if we were to try and do them manually, we would have to hire someone full-time just to approximate the same work, and to really replicate it with the same quality and consistency, we'd probably need two or three people,"" Matt said. Here's what Zapier has allowed the Georgia Innocence Project to get done: Process and track 270 open records requests over ~2 yearsProcess 830 intern applicants over ~2 yearsReceive and track 5,360 phone calls over 4.5 yearsReview 628 job applicants for 14 different positionsTrack 10,591.6 hours of volunteer/intern time over 3 yearsProcess 2,400 expense records over 3 yearsMatt has always considered persistence as one of his most important professional skills: he's willing to just plug away at things until they were done.""I still see that as important, but using Zapier has helped me think my way around problems,"" he said. ""If there's a project that would require 10 hours of work approached head-on, my first thought isn’t that I need to get started right away, but that I need to think about alternative approaches before diving in. I’ve learned that most of the time there are dozens of ways to tackle a problem and that choosing the right method can lead to compounding efficiencies as you go.""What's your story?

These tools experienced a dramatic rise in adoption over the past few years due to the acceleration of digital transformation from the pandemic, and that growth continues to gain momentum.Who are the current adopters of no-code tools? Which business departments are being most impacted? What are the biggest challenges and blockers of no-code adoption? And how has this impacted overall business growth in the U.S.?This study seeks answers to many of these questions, evaluates total industry impact, and makes business predictions for the short, medium, and long term.Key takeaways:82% of no-code users started using no-code tools during the pandemic90% of no-code users think their company has been able to grow faster due to its no-code usage76% of no-code users use no-code tools for their own personal projects85% of no-code users plan to use no-code tools more in the next yearZapier is the leader in no-code automation—integrating with 5,000+ apps from partners like Google, Salesforce, and Microsoft. Build secure, automated systems for your business-critical workflows across your organization's technology stack. Learn more. No-code boomThe data shows an enormous rise in the use of no-code tools from the beginning of 2020 to the beginning of 2022. In fact, the majority of no-code users started using these tools during the pandemic—with over 4 out of 5 having their first no-code experience within the past two years.According to Gartner, not only are new users continuing to flock to no-code tools, but existing users are increasing their usage: currently, nearly 60% of all custom apps are built outside the IT department. And by 2025, 70% of new applications developed by organizations will use no-code or low-code tools, up from less than 25% in 2020.90% of no-code users think their company has been able to grow faster due to its no-code usageWith so many new users trying no-code tools for the first time, how are these new users learning to use these tools? Our results show that not only are the bulk of no-code users self-taught, but many are taking the initiative to watch free videos (26%), paying for an online course (23%), or simply teaching themselves through trial and error (18%). For those who benefit from additional learning resources, leveraging work resources is the most common method, with 31% receiving formal training at work and 6% informally asking someone else at work to teach them.Factors behind the boomTo understand how the current set of business, industry, and societal circumstances fueled the adoption of no-code tools, we asked users why they started using no-code tools and the underlying factors that drove their interest.The results support the conclusion that the time-savings benefits of no-code tools are primary drivers of usage. But those time savings were identified by a wide range of people: individuals for their professional work, individuals for their side projects and businesses, and company managers and leaders.And as these users become more savvy with no-code tools, they have a better understanding of the types of potential benefits. We wanted to know which of these benefits was most important to the continued use of these tools.While task-oriented time savings (83%), automation (76%), and flexibility (74%) rank as the top three reasons for continuing to invest in no-code tools, many users were finding multiple benefits from their usage—solving multiple business problems simultaneously. Once an individual uses no-code tools for one aspect of their personal or professional life, they are increasingly likely to use the tool again for another task in a different setting.Who is using no-code tools?Despite the benefits of no-code tools to those without a technical background, nearly 9 in 10 users have some type of prior technical knowledge. This supports the conclusion that despite the rise in no-code tool usage, the industry still has widespread growth ahead of it, as millions of non-technical users—those who likely could benefit most from no-code tools—discover its potential power.Even though many professional developers or engineers could code their own technical solutions, more than 1 out of 3 no-code users are currently technical professionals who choose to use the tools anyway. Why? Because of the time savings, the ability to rapidly prototype solutions, the ability to empower other non-technical users to make changes after deployment, and also to free up mental focus for other more complex development or programming tasks.This result supports the conclusion that those already knowledgeable about the technical demands of coding are still the ones most likely to recognize the potential benefits of no-code tools.But despite the landscape of current adopters, our results also show that technical and non-technical users alike are benefiting professionally from no-code tool usage. While there are certainly ""soft benefits,"" like the ability to be more productive at work, there are also more tangible ""hard benefits,"" like positive company recognition (82%), additional compensation (70%), and the possibility of a promotion (60%) to go along with it. The ability to skillfully implement the use of no-code tools may be increasingly viewed as a difference-making ability and prized skillset.No-code usage and the challenges facedWe asked survey respondents about their frequency of no-code tool usage to understand how core these tools were to their workflows. Notably, more than 8 out of 10 no-code users use no-code tools at least once per week, with nearly two-thirds using them multiple times per week. With weekly usage considered the gold standard for many software as a service (SaaS) providers, the extremely high usage rate with minimal fall-off over time suggests the high value being delivered by such tools. For the 1 out of 4 no-code users who are using such tools daily, that frequent level of usage suggests that no-code tools have become indispensable to the operation of their businesses and job functions.To understand what stands in the way of even greater usage, we asked respondents to comment on the issues or blockers they most commonly experience when using these tools.More than one-third of respondents identified issues related to troubleshooting—including not knowing what to do when something goes wrong (36%) and unexpected errors that impact others (34%)—as the two most common challenges.Following up in a close third position, respondents identified a lack of examples to follow or model after (32%). Increasing access to instructional and troubleshooting content, including official resources and help from other no-code users, should be a significant industry goal.Importance of no-code to companiesGiven the apparent importance of no-code tools to a growing set of businesses, we wanted to know which divisions or departments within a company had been most impacted. Are no-code tools having a bigger impact on the back-office operations of a company or the front-line departments like sales?For those respondents who said their department relies on no-code tools heavily or could not function without them, IT Operations led the pack with 63%—mirroring results that showed professional coders and developers as the most prolific users—but virtually all other departments from diverse areas such as product development, research and development, sales, accounting, and human resources reported reliance on no-code tools above the 50% benchmark.These results highlight the impact of no-code tools on an entire organization—not just in one or two specific areas.How big is the extent of this organization-wide, cross-department impact? More than one-third of users report that no-code tools have saved them individually 10 to 20 hours worth of work, while 10% of users say that such tools have saved them at least an entire 40-hour workweek.The future of no-codeOverall, our results indicate high new user adoption of no-code tools, very high frequency of usage by existing users, impact across the entire business organization, and large amounts of potential users who could greatly benefit but haven't yet taken the plunge.As far as no-code tools have already come, the industry is still at an early stage: as more people try out these tools and experience the benefits first-hand, high adoption rates will fuel high repeat usage rates that will further increase the prevalence and reliance on these tools.In fact, our data shows that more than 8 out of 10 no-code users plan to increase their usage during the coming calendar year.85% of no-code users plan to use no-code tools more in the next yearThe result will not only be a proliferation of no-code tools to new businesses and sectors—with no-code users expected to grow by 40% a year until 2025—but also an increasing application of no-code tools to mission-critical use cases for small, medium, and large companies alike.This impact isn't listed just to our work lives: 3 out of 4 current no-code users say they also use such tools for their own personal projects.76% of no-code users use no-code tools for their own personal projectsThat last one point is especially noteworthy: no-code tools in the not-too-distant-future may not only power the underlying operating system of businesses in all sectors, but it may provide the essential foundation that allows other personal and early-stage projects to thrive.Get productivity tips delivered straight to your inboxSubscribeWe’ll email you 1-3 times per week—and never share your information.Zapier Editorial TeamThe Zapier editorial team is an experienced group of writers and editors who want to help people be more productive at work.tagsAutomationRelated articlesData reportsOver half of tech companies don't think they'll survive a prolonged recessionOver half of tech companies don't think...Data reportsZapier report: 40% of Americans have a side hustle in 2022Zapier report: 40% of Americans have a side...Data reportsZapier report: The future of workZapier report: The future of workData reportsZapier report: Pandemic business boomZapier report: Pandemic business boomImprove your productivity automatically.

""And those who use it don't know how to describe it to their friends. We wanted to make it simple, so it's easy to share and to be able to speak with the same voice.""We knew it was time for a rebrand: a way to shift perception toward a more expansive vision of how automation will change how businesses run and how Zapier helps that happen. Zapier needed a brand identity that communicated how big the possibilities are for the company and our users.At its founding in 2011, Zapier was one of very few tools in the no-code workflow automation space. That's changed. People's awareness of automation is growing, and how they feel about the different tools available will inform their decisions about which ones to use.""We'd never really done a full exploration of the brand,"" said Zapier Chief Marketing Officer Moody Glasgow. ""Our brand came together piece by piece over time. Philosophically, as a marketer, I believe brand is the most important thing you can do, but it's not necessarily the first thing you do.""A brand to communicate new possibilitiesZapier needed a brand identity that communicated how big the possibilities are for the company and our users.""Folks needed to look at us and think, 'This is going to be the future,'"" Jeter said.To start, we needed to understand our place in the overall culture of no-code automation. We worked with DeeDee Gordon of The Gordon Co. to determine what the cultural trajectory is in our space and learn the challenges for people adopting automation as a way to get work done. They created a brief for our first-ever brand campaign, and we used those insights to inform the rest of the rebrand.One of the things we learned: our audience is busy. ""The people who are most likely going to need automation are victims of their own success,"" Jeter said. ""They have so much to do that they need a tool to get it done, but they're already too busy to find a tool, learn a tool, and use a tool.""Another part of the rebrand: Finding the right tone to use when talking about ourselves. ""How do we want to make people feel when they interact with us?"" Jeter said. ""Do we want to be serious and reserved, or do we want to reflect what our users say about us, which is 'I feel like a wizard when I use Zapier'?""Spoiler: it was the latter.Creating the brandWith the strategy in place, it was time to create the visual identity system to bring the brand to life. We partnered with Instrument, a design agency, early in the process, who brought us to ""the new possible"" as the name of the brand. Our in-house design team was small, and working with Instrument expanded the size of the team while adding valuable perspective and expertise.""Sometimes you want someone who can see from the outside like a user does and bring a fresh perspective to the work,"" Jeter said. ""Also, brand identities are giant pieces of work. There are a lot of things a brand needs to be successful. Agencies who work on branding are going to be really good at identifying what's missing and managing the intricacies.""Our rebrand partnersDuring the months we worked with Instrument to develop the visual identity system—including a new logo, new fonts, colors, and other graphic elements—they helped us navigate the process, providing updates to leadership and ensuring all the elements we needed were in place.By late 2021, leadership had chosen a brand identity with a logo based around a Z that echoed the energy of a lightning bolt. The rebrand was scheduled for April. As we prepared for launch, we saw the Z become a symbol of Putin's Army and the war on Ukraine. Despite being so close to launch, rolling out a new brand with a giant Z during this time was counter to our values. Zapier decided to start over, giving the team three weeks to find a new visual identity to communicate our brand.Because of the short timeline, this rebrand was handled in-house, by the now-expanded design team, with some help from the Instrument team, who provided feedback and assistance.Back to the drawing boardJeter gave most of the design team a week off to rest and regroup. Three people—writer Candace Green, program manager Sabrina Summers, and manager of design operations Meghan Yip—worked with him through the break to develop a plan that would guide the rebrand sprint.With a new logo coming, nearly everything needed to be redone, including choosing new fonts and evaluating colors. Jeter worked first with leadership to ensure they understood why this was the right approach and to gain their support. Then, he worked with his team to bring them on board and find places everyone could contribute.Vice President of Insights and Design Sheryl Soo saw this as an opportunity to re-engage the team in the creative process. ""We looked to the team to go wild with their explorations, to re-examine the brand from every angle, to help us find something that could ultimately 'beat the Z,'"" she said.Jeter drove this process, working in the open and inviting anyone with the energy, time, and emotional availability to help. He gave almost daily updates on the work, showing whatever had been done that day, regardless of whether it was something they liked.When he landed on the new logo—the orange platform—it was quickly evident it was the right choice. ""Personally, I knew straight away that this could be it,"" Soo said. ""But I wasn't 100% sure how others would react. I actually took the logo on a bit of a secret roadshow during the Exec retreat to get some reactions.""Everyone loved it, she said, and they knew this was the one.Internally, we talk about Zapier as a platform—a product and system that people use in many different ways, Jeter said. This logo allows Zapier to do the same thing with its brand.""The thing I'm most proud of with the visual identity system is that it both gets out of the way of and allows us to tell any story that is relevant to our users,"" Jeter said. The platform in the logo becomes a stage that can highlight anything—photos or videos of an actual user or something more emotional, like the story of a user feeling like a wizard by using automation. And it helps Zapier compete for people's attention against anything on the internet—from other brands to cat videos to TikTok dances.The brand in action One of the risks with a rebrand is losing equity you've already built. For Zapier, there was a 10-year history with the asterisk logo and signature bright orange. A lot was due for change with this rebrand, but the team stuck with the orange, making it bolder and brighter.""Orange is a beloved color at Zapier,"" Jeter said. ""Instrument found the story of 'international orange' and it was perfect. I love that our brand that is all about new possibilities is using the same orange that astronauts used to go to space.""No matter how you feel about a rebrand internally, the real test comes once it's rolled out. ""People are going to have hot takes. We were ready for that,"" Jeter said. Determining the real success of a rebrand takes time.Yet, the initial response, Jeter said, has been positive.""For us, people were really celebrating it and being excited about how interesting and unique and dynamic it was,"" Jeter said. My good friend @highlydoctored just shipped the @zapier rebrand. The best startup rebrand I’ve seen a long while 🎯Zapier now has life to it! https://t.co/kmfR7NnJEV— Kurt Varner (@kurtvarner) July 6, 2022 Given the whole story behind it—with the last-minute switch and development of the second rebrand—that response has been amazing.""This was an impossible task. It shouldn't have been able to be done at all,"" Jeter said.He credits the design team with making it happen. And in particular, the folks behind the design system, who ultimately had to prep for three launches—first, the one with the scrapped Z logo, then an interim rebrand that brought in new colors and fonts but kept the asterisk logo, and finally the full rebrand that included the orange platform logo.""Every single person at every level had an impossible task, and they achieved it,"" Jeter said. ""Not any team could have done this. This one not only did it but did it really well. The team was forged in fire. You can't buy that."" Get productivity tips delivered straight to your inboxSubscribeWe’ll email you 1-3 times per week—and never share your information.Janine AndersonJanine Anderson is Zapier's content operations manager, and a former managing editor at Zapier.

About ServiceTitanCompany size: 1,600+Industry: ServiceTitan has grown into the world's leading software for residential and commercial service companies. Location: Glendale, CAAutomatic data entry for a better customer experienceChallengeInefficient (and inaccurate) data entry kept ServiceTitan from providing prompt, tailored communications to customers.

From there, the right people can act on the most up-to-date lead information. ResultsNow, ServiceTitan has more time to focus on high-value tasks like strategic planning. Plus, thanks to automatic data entry, they have error-free lead info in the apps their teams are actually using—allowing them to follow up quickly and accurately. ""When SeviceTitan was a scrappy start-up company with a small marketing department, Zapier empowered us to solve our data problems quickly and accurately. We're much larger now, but still are finding helpful ways to use Zapier.""Matt GrebowSenior Manager of Demand Generation at ServiceTitanRead more on our blogReady to get started?

(“Zapier”) has designed and developed to, among other things, allow certain people to access developmental, test, experimental, and/or early-access features of the Zapier Service (the “Beta Features”) and to provide Zapier with feedback and comments regarding such Beta Features.In order to participate, you must: (1) be a Zapier customer who has already agreed to the Zapier Terms of Service located at: https://zapier.com/tos (the “Zapier TOS”) and the Zapier Privacy Policy located at: https://zapier.com/privacy (the “Zapier Privacy Policy”); and (2) agree to these Zapier Early Access Program Terms of Use (the “Terms”). Capitalized but undefined terms shall have the meaning set forth in the Zapier TOS.1. Feedback. By enrolling in the Zapier Early Access Program you will have the ability to: (i) test, evaluate, and analyze Beta Features which may be temporarily made available to you at Zapier's sole and exclusive discretion; and (ii) provide feedback, analysis, suggestions, and comments to Zapier (including, but not limited to, bug reports and test results) (collectively, “Feedback”). By participating in the Zapier Early Access Program, you agree that any Feedback you provide will become the property of Zapier and that Zapier may use or otherwise exploit all or part of your Feedback or any derivative thereof in any manner or media now known without any further remuneration, compensation, or credit to you. You represent and warrant that you have the right to enter into these Terms and assign and grant the rights set forth herein, and that any Feedback which is provided by you hereunder is original work made solely by you and does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights.2. Incorporation of Zapier TOS. You acknowledge and agree that the terms of the Zapier TOS shall apply with respect to the Zapier Early Access Program where applicable, including without limitation, Section 3 (Your Use of the Service and Restrictions), Section 4 (Terms that Apply to Your Data), and Section 5 (Proprietary Rights and Improving the Service). To the extent these Terms conflict with the terms of the Zapier TOS, the more restrictive terms shall control in each case.3. Confidentialitya.

Obligations Regarding Confidential Information. You agree to: (i) use Confidential Information only for the Purpose; (ii) not disclose Confidential Information to any third parties (including the sharing of any images or recordings of Beta Features); and (iii) use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care (including reasonable security measures), to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication of Confidential Information as you would use to protect your own confidential information of like nature.c. Remedies. You agree that any breach of these Terms by you may result in irreparable harm to Zapier, for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Zapier shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction, in the event of such breach.4. Ownership. Zapier owns and shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Zapier Early Access Program and any products, services, and materials that are part of the Zapier Early Access Program, and any modifications, customizations, or derivations thereto.5.

Term. Zapier may, in its sole discretion, at any time, terminate or discontinue the Zapier Early Access Program or any or all Beta Features offered through it, discontinue your participation in the Zapier Early Access Program, or remove any Feedback that you share. You acknowledge and agree that all such decisions by Zapier are final and Zapier will have no liability with respect to such decisions.7.
